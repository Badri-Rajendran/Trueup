# Project Instructions

This is a **production application**. Every change ships to real users — no placeholder logic,
no debug code, no hard-coded secrets, no unhandled failure paths.

## Stack

| Layer | Technology |
| --- | --- |
| Backend | Python + Flask |
| ORM | SQLAlchemy |
| Database | PostgreSQL |
| Migrations | Alembic |
| Frontend | ReactJS |
| Containerization | Docker / Docker Compose |
| Remote repository | GitHub |
| CI/CD | GitHub Actions |
| Cloud | Microsoft Azure |

- Do not add or swap a framework, database, or cloud provider without an ADR.

## Ways of working

- Behave as a senior software developer: analyse requirements, clarify material ambiguity, make maintainable changes, and validate results.
- Follow the SDLC strictly: requirements → design → decisions → implementation → testing → documentation → review → commit → deploy.
- Always work on a `feature_*`, `bugfix_*`, or `patch_*` branch; never on `main` unless instructed.
- Read [backend](backend/CLAUDE.md) or [frontend](frontend/CLAUDE.md) guidance before changing code in any end.
- Treat [requirements](docs/requirements/), [architecture](docs/architecture.md), and
  [ADRs](docs/decisions/) as the source of truth for scope, design, and decisions.
- Record material architectural choices as an ADR in [docs/decisions](docs/decisions/) before or
  alongside implementation.
- Use the [Makefile](Makefile) to run individual services or the full application where targets exist.

## Pull requests

- Raise a PR with the GitHub plugin after each feature is complete.
- State problem, implementation, validation evidence, and security/DB/API impact in the PR body.
- Merge only when every CI check is green, and there are no unresolved comments.

## CI/CD (GitHub Actions)

- Maintain comprehensive workflows in `.github/workflows/`, triggered on every PR when it is marked as ready to review and on `main`.
- CI: lint, unit + integration tests, API tests, UI component tests, coverage thresholds.
- CI also: dependency and secret scanning, SAST, Docker build + image vulnerability scan, Alembic
  migration check.
- CD: push images to Azure Container Registry, run Alembic migrations, deploy to Azure.
- Gate production deploys on green CI plus manual approval; keep rollback a single re-run.
- Store secrets in GitHub Environments / Azure Key Vault — never in the repo or workflow files.

## Security

- Follow OWASP strictly: Top 10 and ASVS for the app, API Security Top 10 for endpoints, and
  LLM Top 10 for AI features.
- Validate all input and encode all output; use parameterized SQLAlchemy queries, never built SQL strings.
- Enforce authentication and authorization on every endpoint, with least-privilege roles.
- Set CSRF protection, strict CORS, and security headers; use secure sessions and hashed passwords.
- Use TLS everywhere, encrypt secrets at rest, and pin plus scan all dependencies.
- Keep secrets and PII out of logs, error responses, and client payloads.
- AI security: treat model input and output as untrusted — defend against prompt injection and
  sanitize LLM output before use.
- Keep secrets and PII out of prompts; enforce rate/cost limits and human approval for privileged actions.
- Never `git add` or `git commit` a `.env` file, in any case or situation.
- Never commit credentials or real customer/insurance data.

## Testing

- No feature is complete without tests and a passing CI run.
- Apply request throttling at the API layer (e.g. Flask-Limiter) and test the configured limits.
- API tests cover happy path, validation errors, authn/authz, boundaries, error responses, and
  throttling behaviour (429 with retry headers) on every endpoint.
- UI component tests for every React component (Vitest + React Testing Library): rendering,
  props/state, user interaction, loading/empty/error states, and accessibility.
- Add or update tests in the same change as the behaviour they cover.
- Use playwright plugin for comprehensive end-to-end automated testing.

## Documentation

- Update [README.md](README.md) whenever setup, usage, architecture, or workflows change.
- Update [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) after every commit with crisp, precise bullets.
